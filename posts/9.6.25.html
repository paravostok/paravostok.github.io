      <h2 class="block-title">citylink woes, ember yearning, and my tailbone.</h2>
      <p><em>8 June 2025</em></p>

      <p>on the 8th of june i fancied a journey, one that was doable but still enough to bump my mileage up – as i feel this might be a slow month miles wise, outside of a weezer concert i’m going to on the 30th, which is a solid 400 miles all together. regardless i wanted to get out and have a travel day. so i did.</p>

      <p>my first destination was edinburgh, specifically the bus station, or really george place, as for whatever reason embee doesn’t actually stop within the bus station, but rather the opposite side of st andrew square, george street. this was the first time i had ridden the full route from my house into the city centre for a while, and it really is no joke: 21 miles over 1 hour 45 mins, an average pace of 12 miles per hour – cycling would be faster. luckily for me, i was on a gemini 3 – one of lothian country’s premier buses – so i took my usual seat at the top right and let my music play.</p>

      <p>after a fairly long, somewhat uncomfortable slog through most of west lothian, we arrived on princes street. immediately after getting off the bus i almost stood on one of the “sand dogs,” a common tourist trap in edinburgh, before recovering and continuing on towards george street.</p>

      <p>turning left onto princes street i was greeted by a temporary construction path, which let me avoid the typical crossing-the-road-in-princes-street blues, and i arrived waiting for my next bus with 20 minutes to spare. through the app i could track my coach: a yutong tce12, which are great, because the toilet sits at the back instead of down a set of stairs – basically the only coach where i’ll actually use the loo.</p>

      <p>the coach arrived 15 minutes early but didn’t board until five minutes before departure. i used the toilet and nearly jumped out of my skin when the flush sounded like someone knocking on the door – coach loos are reliably loud and ominous. once aboard, the driver helped older passengers stow luggage, then a solo scottish lady on a bike asked me where the chargers were. still half in daydream mode, i pointed to the socket on the seat in front of me. she nodded, boarded, and off we went, smooth as edinburgh roads allow.</p>

      <p>i realised my tailbone was still sore (note to self: get that checked) every time we bumped over cracks. our coach headed north for dundee – easily my favourite scottish city outside glasgow – while perth remains my least favourite of the eight. before long, we were deep into fife, passing an lner train crossing the forth road bridge. ember usually uses the queensferry crossing, so i suspect dynamic routing diverted us over the old bridge to beat the traffic.</p>

      <p>this dynamic system is a big plus for ember: request-stop only if you pre-book ten minutes ahead, and the coach adapts to bookings, cancellations, and jams in real time. i overheard the driver describe ember’s rise: from two coaches a few years ago to eighty-plus today, with england routes on the horizon. my hope? glasgow to carlisle as the UK’s first intra-UK electric coach route – and free for national entitlement card holders.</p>

      <p>nearing dundee, i spotted a plane taking off from dundee airport – rare these days, with only ~42,000 passengers in 2023. once in town, i stretched my legs after nearly four hours seated, then ducked into the V&A loo (where i startled a cleaner who’d forgotten to lock the door). i regrouped at the train station to plan my wander: overgate, the city centre, hit greggs (no hashbrowns, so a chocolate muffin and lucozade instead), then plotted home.</p>

      <p>i aimed for glasgow from seagate bus station – underwhelming but similar in size to edinburgh’s. the station toilet was closed and the nearest was a 10-minute walk, so i sprint-walked to wellgate. i took a wrong turn into the closed library, backtracked, found the shopping centre loo – a pay-to-enter 20p pit – and nearly missed my coach. chaos, but i made it.</p>

      <p>the queue for glasgow was long. i boarded a double-deck citylink coach – love the upper-deck views – but my usual top-right seat was taken, so i sat a few rows back. i hydrated and snacked, the rain tapped the windows, and i nearly nodded off. the sway and turns kept me awake until we pulled into buchanan at 20:08.</p>

      <p>in glasgow i found another paid loo (ugh), then planned to catch the flixbus 090 to livingston’s deer park. but as i arrived, it pulled away. so i did the unthinkable: the 902. it meanders through every small town en route to edinburgh airport, but stops near whitburn – my fallback. the 902’s old moquette reminded me how i trashed my tailbone on it before. i rode homebound through greater glasgow scenery, music in my ears, grateful to be headed back.</p>

      <p>near my stop i flagged the driver, crossed a sketchy HGV exit without a crossing, stumbled past a rotting bird corpse (trauma flash: my girlfriend and i watched it get hit days ago), and finally hit west lothian turf. the lothian app showed my bus waiting at heartlands services, but the road crossings were brutal, so i walked the last mile up the hill. at 20:33, after 180 miles and 6 hrs 27 mins of buses, i collapsed home.</p>

      <p>takeaway: the 902 can save your arse, but being the only option sucks. trains exist, but the prices kill me – plus buses drop me at buchanan, not queen street low level. ember rules and needs more routes. and frankly, coaches on B-roads just feels wrong.</p>
