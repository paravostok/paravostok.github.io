      <p><em>2 June 2025</em></p>

      <p>On the 31st may this year, I embarked upon a 13 hour trip, from Armadale, to Glasgow, to Perth (Broxden), to Edinburgh, to Glasgow, to Edinburgh (Airport), to the Drum Brae to catch my bus home. Only one problem, due to the Robbie Williams Concert 
        at Murrayfield Lothian was running the service X12 for concert-goers, and presumably a lack of free vehichles, Lothian Buses made the executive decision to simply not run some bus services, and to use the now-free vehichles for this route,
        unfortunately for me, this included the last X18 that ran the full route to Whitburn, the next one only going to Bathgate (2 miles from my home), which normally I wouldn't mind, an excuse to stretch the legs, but given a concert had just finished,
        and the fact it would get me there past midnight, I figured maybe a train would be the better option, alas the last train was in around 1 hour from Edinburgh Park, which sure is a while away from Drum Brae, but I've done longer previously.
        One issue however, my phone was on 1%, so what if I got there, couldn't pay for a ticket and got stranded. Then what? .</p>
